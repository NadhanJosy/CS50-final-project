AI Assistance Disclosure:
This project was started during Week 6 of CS50 and developed over approximately
two months. I used AI tools (Claude / Gemini) as a support resource during
development.

All code was either written by me or reviewed, adapted, and implemented by me.

                    <p>
                        This Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) is designed to assist
                        healthcare professionals in the diagnostic process by providing
                        differential diagnosis suggestions based on symptom patterns. It is
                        intended for <strong>educational and decision support purposes only</strong>.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="mt-4">2. Not a Medical Device</h4>
                    <p>
                        This system is <strong>NOT</strong>:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A substitute for professional medical judgment</li>
                        <li>A medical device or diagnostic tool</li>
                        <li>Capable of providing final diagnoses</li>
                        <li>Approved for making treatment decisions without clinical verification</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="mt-4">3. Clinical Judgment Required</h4>
                    <p>
                        All diagnostic suggestions generated by this system <strong>MUST</strong>:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Be reviewed by qualified healthcare professionals</li>
                        <li>Be verified through appropriate clinical examination</li>
                        <li>Be confirmed with additional diagnostic testing when indicated</li>
                        <li>Consider the complete clinical context</li>
